# raspoppyfication

All the files are derived from Pierre ROUANET's initial work : https://github.com/poppy-project/raspoppy

This deposit was initially just a way for me to save the state of the scripts I have modified until they work for the raspoppyfification of a Rpi4. The main modifications are tagged with #JLC inside the scripts.

I have begin to re-write the main script raspoppyfication.sh after the work was done on an RPi4, but I have not yet test if it works or not.
